# ExoKnee
Arduino code for a wearable robot focused around moving the knee with a C++ User Interface.

This project is meant to help those with walking/gait issues, particularly those who are children from 6-8 years old that have trouble bending their knee. With the sensor network connected correctly, this program reads the userâ€™s movement. If connected to a linear actuator that lifts the leg, it will move to lift and let fall the user's leg, furthering their movement.
